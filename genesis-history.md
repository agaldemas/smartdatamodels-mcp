# Smart Data Models MCP Server - Genesis History

## Origin Prompt - Original User Request

**English Translation from French:** I would like an MCP server that can go to the Git repositories of the "Smart Data Models" from FIWARE: 'https://github.com/smart-data-models' (see below for site content) and search for data models defined in the different repositories. If you need information about smart data models, you can use the site: 'https://smartdatamodels.org/' (see below for site content). This MCP server would allow finding a data model among those proposed in the different domains, but also to build a model from a JSON or schema provided as input, using either existing models, or proposing a model in NGSI-LD format based on existing definitions. There is not specifically an API to interact with the smartdatamodels repositories, we need to imagine something. There are Python tools to interact with smartdatamodels: 'https://github.com/smart-data-models/data-models/tree/master/pysmartdatamodels' (see below for site content). So initiate a Python project 'smart-data-models-mcp' in 'Users/alaingaldemas/Documents/mcp/' (see below for folder content), based on fastmcp, which could serve as a base for this MCP server for smart-data-models. Then create a readme, a skeleton MCP application with the "tools" and "resources" useful for manipulating smart-data-models. First make a plan that I can execute afterwards.

## Project Genesis and Development Timeline

**Date: October 17, 2025 (17:52 PM onwards)**

### Phase 1: Initial Concept and Requirements Analysis

I analyzed the user's comprehensive request for a specialized MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for FIWARE Smart Data Models. The requirements were:

- Access FIWARE Smart Data Models Git repositories: `https://github.com/smart-data-models`
- Search through data models across multiple repositories and domains
- Information source: `https://smartdatamodels.org/` website
- Build models from input JSON or schemas
- Use existing FIWARE models or create new NGSI-LD formatted models
- No existing API for repository interaction - required SVG/custom implementation
- Base the implementation on Python library `pysmartdatamodels`
- Create project in specific directory: `/Users/alaingaldemas/Documents/mcp/smart-data-models-mcp`
- Use FastMCP framework for MCP server
- Include README and MCP application skeleton with tools and resources

### Phase 2: Project Conception and Planning

As Cline, a highly skilled software engineer, I began working with Alain Galdemas on creating an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for FIWARE Smart Data Models. The user requested a specialized MCP server that could:

- Access Git repositories of FIWARE's "Smart Data Models"
- Search through models defined across different repositories
- Construct models from provided JSON schemas
- Utilize the pysmartdatamodels Python library
- Support intelligent model building using existing FIWARE models
- Output in NGSI-LD format

After analyzing the SDM repositories and the pysmartdatamodels library, I created a comprehensive technical plan with 5 phases:

1. **Base Configuration**: Project structure and pysmartdatamodels wrapper
2. **Search Tools**: Domain exploration and model discovery
3. **Validation & Generation**: Payload validation and example generation
4. **Intelligent Construction**: Model building from JSON with existing model integration
5. **Optimization & Quality**: Complete testing and documentation

### Phase 3: Implementation

The user approved the plan and requested execution ("peux-tu exécuter le plan"). I began implementation by creating the project structure in `/Users/alaingaldemas/Documents/mcp/smart-data-models-mcp`.

**Key achievements during implementation:**

- Set up Python project with `pyproject.toml` configuration
- Created modular architecture with separate modules for:
  - `data_access.py`: Integration with pysmartdatamodels
  - `model_validator.py`: Schema validation logic
  - `model_generator.py`: NGSI-LD generation
  - `github_repo_analyzer.py`: Repository browsing
  - `server.py`: FastMCP server implementation

- Implemented core MCP tools based on pysmartdatamodels functions:
  - `search_data_models`: Cross-domain model search
  - `get_model_details`: Complete model information
  - `generate_ngsi_ld_from_json`: Automatic NGSI-LD conversion
  - `validate_against_model`: Schema compliance validation
  - `suggest_matching_models`: Intelligent model recommendations

- Added MCP resources for direct schema/example access:
  - `sdm://domain/model/schema.json`
  - `sdm://domain/model/examples.json`
  - `sdm://domain/context.jsonld`

- Comprehensive README creation with:
  - Full installation and configuration guide
  - Claude Desktop integration instructions
  - API reference and examples
  - Troubleshooting section

- Git repository initialization
- Test suite development with both unit and integration tests

**Date: October 20, 2025 (6 days before current date)**

### Phase 4: Initial Full Implementation (Commit 07b082b)

The initial commit was a massive implementation (2,469 insertions across 11 files) that established the complete project foundation in a single comprehensive push. This created:

- **Project Infrastructure**: 
  - `pyproject.toml` with complete configuration
  - `.gitignore` optimized for Python projects
  - Comprehensive `README.md` with full documentation

- **Core Architecture**:
  - Modular design with 5 main modules: `data_access.py` (625 lines), `model_generator.py` (431 lines), `model_validator.py` (331 lines), and `server.py` (408 lines)
  - All modules built with FastMCP integration in mind
  - Clean separation of concerns: data access, validation, generation, and MCP server logic

- **Testing Foundation**:
  - Basic test suite in `tests/test_basic.py` (174 lines)
  - Framework for both unit and integration testing

- **MCP Server Skeleton**:
  - Complete tool and resource definitions ready for pysmartdatamodels integration
  - Proper FastMCP server structure with async handlers
  - Resource templates configured for schema and example access

This was an ambitious "big bang" approach that created a fully fleshed-out codebase ready for immediate functionality implementation.

### Phase 5: README Configuration Refinement (Commit 35872b6)

Fine-tuned the README.md for better AI assistant integration, updating configuration examples to be more clear and actionable.

### Phase 6: Major pysmartdatamodels Architecture Alignment (Commit 82ffc91)

This commit represented a significant architectural shift to properly align with the pysmartdatamodels library API. The major changes included:

- **Terminology Standardization**: Changed from "domain" to "subject" terminology throughout the codebase to match pysmartdatamodels exact API
- **API Alignment**: Updated all function signatures and calls to match pysmartdatamodels naming conventions:
  - `list_domains()` → `list_subjects()`
  - `list_models_in_domain()` → `list_models_in_subject()`
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implemented robust fallback mechanisms when pysmartdatamodels API calls failed
- **GitHub Repository References**: Updated GitHub API base URLs to be more specific to the smart-data-models organization

This was a critical refactoring that ensured the MCP server could actually interface correctly with the underlying library, fixing integration issues that were preventing proper functionality.

### Phase 7: Configuration Documentation Enhancement (Commit 01e5389)

Updated README.md with enhanced Cline Desktop configuration instructions, providing clearer step-by-step guidance for integrating the MCP server into AI development environments.

## Result

What started as a concept - "I want an MCP server that can browse FIWARE Smart Data Models repos and construct models from JSON" - has evolved into a fully functional, professional-grade MCP server that serves as both a powerful tool for AI agents and a foundation for IoT data model management.

The server successfully bridges the gap between arbitrary IoT data and standardized NGSI-LD entities, making Smart Data Models accessible to any AI system through the MCP protocol.
