# Smart Data Models MCP Server - Genesis History

## Origin Prompt - Original User Request

**English Translation from French:** I would like an MCP server that can go to the Git repositories of the "Smart Data Models" from FIWARE: 'https://github.com/smart-data-models' and search for data models defined in the different repositories. If you need information about smart data models, you can use the site: 'https://smartdatamodels.org/'. This MCP server would allow finding a data model among those proposed in the different domains, but also to build a model from a JSON or schema provided as input, using either existing models, or proposing a model in NGSI-LD format based on existing definitions. There is not specifically an API to interact with the smartdatamodels repositories, we need to imagine something. There are Python tools to interact with smartdatamodels: 'https://github.com/smart-data-models/data-models/tree/master/pysmartdatamodels'. So initiate a Python project 'smart-data-models-mcp' in 'Users/alaingaldemas/Documents/mcp/', based on fastmcp, which could serve as a base for this MCP server for smart-data-models. Then create a readme, a skeleton MCP application with the "tools" and "resources" useful for manipulating smart-data-models. First make a plan that I can execute afterwards.

## Project Genesis and Development Timeline

**Date: October 17, 2025 (17:52 PM onwards)**

### Phase 1: Initial Concept and Requirements Analysis

I analyzed the user's comprehensive request for a specialized MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for FIWARE Smart Data Models. The requirements were:

- Access FIWARE Smart Data Models Git repositories: `https://github.com/smart-data-models`
- Search through data models across multiple repositories and domains
- Information source: `https://smartdatamodels.org/` website
- Build models from input JSON or schemas
- Use existing FIWARE models or create new NGSI-LD formatted models
- No existing API for repository interaction - required SVG/custom implementation
- Base the implementation on Python library `pysmartdatamodels`
- Create project in specific directory: `/Users/alaingaldemas/Documents/mcp/smart-data-models-mcp`
- Use FastMCP framework for MCP server
- Include README and MCP application skeleton with tools and resources

### Phase 2: Project Conception and Planning

As Cline, a highly skilled software engineer, I began working with Alain Galdemas on creating an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for FIWARE Smart Data Models. The user requested a specialized MCP server that could:

- Access Git repositories of FIWARE's "Smart Data Models"
- Search through models defined across different repositories
- Construct models from provided JSON schemas
- Utilize the pysmartdatamodels Python library
- Support intelligent model building using existing FIWARE models
- Output in NGSI-LD format

After analyzing the SDM repositories and the pysmartdatamodels library, I created a comprehensive technical plan with 5 phases:

1. **Base Configuration**: Project structure and pysmartdatamodels wrapper
2. **Search Tools**: Domain exploration and model discovery
3. **Validation & Generation**: Payload validation and example generation
4. **Intelligent Construction**: Model building from JSON with existing model integration
5. **Optimization & Quality**: Complete testing and documentation

### Phase 3: Implementation

The user approved the plan and requested execution ("peux-tu exécuter le plan"). I began implementation by creating the project structure in `/Users/alaingaldemas/Documents/mcp/smart-data-models-mcp`.

**Key achievements during implementation:**

- Set up Python project with `pyproject.toml` configuration
- Created modular architecture with separate modules for:
  - `data_access.py`: Integration with pysmartdatamodels
  - `model_validator.py`: Schema validation logic
  - `model_generator.py`: NGSI-LD generation
  - `github_repo_analyzer.py`: Repository browsing
  - `server.py`: FastMCP server implementation

- Implemented core MCP tools based on pysmartdatamodels functions:
  - `search_data_models`: Cross-domain model search
  - `get_model_details`: Complete model information
  - `generate_ngsi_ld_from_json`: Automatic NGSI-LD conversion
  - `validate_against_model`: Schema compliance validation
  - `suggest_matching_models`: Intelligent model recommendations

- Added MCP resources for direct schema/example access:
  - `sdm://domain/model/schema.json`
  - `sdm://domain/model/examples.json`
  - `sdm://domain/context.jsonld`

- Comprehensive README creation with:
  - Full installation and configuration guide
